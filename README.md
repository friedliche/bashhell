# The bash from hell

This is inspired by "The Bastard Operator From Hell" http://bofh.bjash.com/bofh/bofh10.html

In this [http://bofh.bjash.com/bofh/bofh10.html] story, he tells a student to check his spelling with the spell command which he modified:

"Especially as I know that my version of spell INTRODUCES errors instead of detecting them. Things like changing friend to freind and vice-versa"

# The idea

First of all, let me explain. With each basic command, we expect a behavior. This .bashrc is should break this pattern and make a system basically unusable.

# cd
