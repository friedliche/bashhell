# The bash from hell

This is inspired by ["The Bastard Operator From Hell"](http://bofh.bjash.com/bofh/bofh10.html)

In [this story](http://bofh.bjash.com/bofh/bofh10.html), he tells a student to check his spelling with the spell command which he modified:

> Especially as I know that my version of spell INTRODUCES errors instead of detecting them. Things like changing friend to freind and vice-versa

# Warning

This .bashrc modifies you commands, which means, that you can delete/lose your files. I am not responsible for any data loss or other problems.

# The idea

This .bashrc is should break the expected behaviour of basic linux commands and make a system unusable.
