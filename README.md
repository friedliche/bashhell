# The bash from hell

This is inspired by ["The Bastard Operator From Hell"](http://bofh.bjash.com/bofh/bofh10.html)

In [this story](http://bofh.bjash.com/bofh/bofh10.html), he tells a student to check his spelling with the spell command which he modified:

> Especially as I know that my version of spell INTRODUCES errors instead of detecting them. Things like changing friend to freind and vice-versa

# The idea

First of all, let me explain. With each basic command, we expect a behavior. This .bashrc is should break this pattern and make a system basically unusable.

# cd 

1. 'cd'
